## About this project
This project was created for an App Development course at the XU University of Applied Science. It was undertaken by two passionate chess enthusiasts who wanted to create a tool to help other chess players improve their skills.

From the early stages of the project, we utilized Lo-Fi and Hi-Fi prototypes in [Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVP2cRqog=/) and [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/wgO5a400t6MuWWSgjG8HnV/Schach-Lernapp?node-id=0%3A1&t=VRDCqVFM887GYU0p-1) to develop a clear vision of what the app should look like and how it should function. However, as the project progressed, we made some changes to our initial designs to improve the user experience and usability of the app.

In terms of development, we initially used Scrum methodology to quickly tackle the initial workload, but later found it difficult to keep up with the strict timelines due to our busy schedules. We ultimately decided to work on the project whenever we had time, while still making sure to meet regularly (at least once a week) to discuss progress, pain points, and any changes that needed to be made.

Throughout the development process, we were dedicated to ensuring that the app would provide value to users. We conducted simple user testing to get feedback on the app's functionality, and made necessary changes to ensure that the app was both easy to use and effective at helping users improve their chess skills.

Overall, this project was a collaborative effort that involved the use of various design and development tools, as well as a commitment to creating an app that met the needs of chess players.
